# MovieDB

Uses The Movie Database to show now-playing films.

A web app (using html, jquery, and css) that calls this endpoint, fetches data 20 movies at a time and displays the movie posters in a grid.

currently has next / prev buttons

These buttons will eventually update the grid of movies by making subsequent API calls with different page query parameter values, e.g. fetch movies 1-20, then fetch movies 21-40.

There is a tooltip that displays the name of the movie below the poster when hovering over a thumbnail.

Page is fully responsive
Responsive modal opens when you click on the movie poster
